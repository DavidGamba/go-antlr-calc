= Go Antlr Calculator

Implements the calculator from chapter 4 of the Antlr book using Go (Golang).

You should buy the book, find a link for it at https://www.antlr.org/

The calculator is an example of Antlr's visitor pattern.

== Warning

I am not an Antlr expert, I haven't even finished reading the book.
If you find a better way please share!

== Setup

. Download the antlr jar and generate the parser for Go.
+
----
$ ./antlr4 -Dlanguage=Go -no-listener -visitor -o parser ./LabeledExpr.g4
----

. Run the code and show the help:
+
----
$ go run main.go -h
----

. Run the code and get a single statement result:
+
----
$ go run main.go 1 + 2
  3
----

. Run the code and read statements from file:
+
----
$ go run main.go -f t.expr
> 193
  193
> a=5
  5
> b=6
  6
> a+b*2
  17
> (1+2)*3
  9
----

. Run the code as a repl:
+
----
$ go run main.go
> a = 1
  1
> b = 2
  2
> a + b
  3
