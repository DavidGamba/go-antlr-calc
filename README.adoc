= Go Antlr Calculator

Implements the calculator from chapter 4 of the Antlr book using Go (Golang).

You should buy the book, find a link for it at https://www.antlr.org/

The calculator is an example of Antlr's visitor pattern.

== Warning

I am not an Antlr expert, I haven't even finished reading the book.
If you find a better way please share!
